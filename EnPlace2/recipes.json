        "Start your jasmine rice first—rinse 1 cup rice until water runs clear, then cook with 1.25 cups water. The rice will be ready by the time your chicken is done. Keep covered until serving.",
        "Mix together the soy sauce, fish sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar in a small bowl. Set this sauce near your stove—Thai cooking goes fast and you'll need everything ready.",
        "Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until smoking. Add 2 tablespoons of oil. When the oil shimmers, add the minced garlic and sliced Thai chilies. Stir-fry for just 10-15 seconds—watch carefully as garlic burns quickly.",
        "Immediately add the ground chicken, breaking it apart with your spatula. Let it sit undisturbed for 30 seconds to get some browning, then stir and continue cooking until no pink remains, about 3-4 minutes.",
        "Pour the sauce mixture over the chicken. Toss everything together over high heat for another minute, allowing the sauce to coat the meat and reduce slightly.",
        "Remove the wok from heat and immediately toss in the Thai basil leaves. Stir just until they begin to wilt—they should still be bright green and fragrant, not completely wilted. The residual heat is enough.",
        "In a separate small pan, fry the eggs in a little oil until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny. Crispy edges are traditional and delicious.",
        "Serve immediately: mound the jasmine rice in bowls, spoon the Thai basil chicken alongside, and top with a fried egg. Break the yolk and let it run into the chicken. Have extra fish sauce and chili flakes at the table."
