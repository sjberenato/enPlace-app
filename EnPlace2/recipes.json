        "Cut the bell peppers into 1/2-inch strips, removing seeds and membranes. Slice the onion into 1/2-inch wedges, keeping some layers connected so they hold together during roasting.",
        "In a large bowl, toss the peppers and onions with olive oil, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper until evenly coated. The vegetables should glisten but not be swimming in oil.",
        "Spread the vegetables in a single layer on the prepared sheet pan, leaving room for the sausages. Nestle the Italian sausages among the vegetables, leaving space around each for even browning.",
        "Pierce each sausage 2-3 times with a fork to prevent bursting and allow fat to render. This also helps the flavors meld with the vegetables.",
        "Roast for 25-30 minutes, flipping the sausages and stirring the vegetables halfway through. The sausages should be golden brown with an internal temperature of 165\u00b0F (74\u00b0C), and the peppers should have lightly charred edges.",
        "Let rest for 2-3 minutes before serving. Serve family-style straight from the pan with crusty Italian bread, over creamy polenta, or stuffed into hoagie rolls with a drizzle of balsamic glaze."

        "Heat the vegetable broth in a saucepan and keep it warm over low heat. Using warm broth is essential\u2014cold broth will shock the rice and make the risotto gummy.",
        "In a separate large, wide skillet, melt 1 tbsp butter over medium-high heat. Add the sliced mushrooms in a single layer. Don't stir for 2-3 minutes to allow them to develop a golden brown crust. Flip and brown the other side. Season with salt and pepper, transfer to a plate.",
        "In the same skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced shallot and cook until soft and translucent, about 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.",
        "Add the Arborio rice to the shallot and stir constantly for 2 minutes. The rice should be coated in oil and become slightly translucent around the edges. This toasting step is important for texture.",
        "Pour in the white wine and stir until it's completely absorbed by the rice. You should be able to see the bottom of the pan when you drag your spoon through.",
        "Begin adding the warm broth one ladle (about 1/2 cup) at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until each addition is mostly absorbed before adding the next. This gradual process takes about 18-22 minutes and creates the creamy texture.",
        "The risotto is done when the rice is tender but still has a slight bite (al dente) and the consistency is creamy and flows slowly when you tilt the pan. It should not be gluey or dry.",
        "Remove from heat and stir in the remaining butter, parmesan cheese, and the saut\u00e9ed mushrooms. Season to taste with salt and pepper. The butter and cheese add final creaminess (this is called mantecatura).",
        "Serve immediately in warm shallow bowls\u2014risotto waits for no one! Garnish with fresh thyme leaves, extra parmesan, and a drizzle of truffle oil if you're feeling fancy."
